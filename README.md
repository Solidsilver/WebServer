# WebServer
A basic HTTP web server written in Java

# How to run:
(These instructions assume the directory where you want to run the server is called $RUNSERV)
- Clone/Move the WebServer folder into the $RUNSERV directory
- Complile by running "javac WebServer/*.java" from $RUNSERV
- Start server by running "java WebServer.WebServer <port#>" from $RUNSERV (note: running without specifying a port number, it will default to 4756)
- Put any files you would like to be accessable by the server in $RUNSERV.
- If accessing locally, navigate to "localhost:<port#>/<filename\>".
